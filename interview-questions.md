# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: 
JSX is a combination of JavaScript and HTML used to create React apps. JSX is what is returned in a component in a react application. One syntax difference is that we must use curly braces {} to wrap our JS code in the return. This lets the program know that we are going to be using JS logic or data. We can then wrap all that JS code inside the curly braces with HTML tags. For example we can wrap paragraph tags around our JS code.<p>{JS code here}</p> 

Researched answer:
JSX stands for JavaScript XML iyt lets us write HTML in React one syntax difference is HTMl only allows static text while JSX allows the input of expressions and functions.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn is a package manager. It installs files into the direcrtory of your choice that adds node modules and allows you to test your code by writing expect statments.

Researched answer:
Yarn is a package manager that's primary function is to install dependencies to allow specific snippets of code to be ran. It modifies the package.json and yarn.lock files.

3. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer:
State value is the current value of a variable, props are data types that we can pass from a component to the main APP.js file or vice versa. One way to compare state and props is imagining state is water and props is a set temperature. The props can change the state but the prop itself will not change. In our example props (the temperature) can be 50 degrees where it would make state (water) a liquid. However a different prop (10 degrees) will change the state and the water will be frozen. Therefore the state was changed but a prop will not change it will only affect the state.

Researched answer:
Props pass data from a parent component to a child, state is used to manage data within a component.

4. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Researched answer: 
A div tag is used as a container, we can style that container with css by assigning it a class name. A span tag is an inline container that allows us to mark up part of text or a document.
